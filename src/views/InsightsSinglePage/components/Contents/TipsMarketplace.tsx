Working with the seller is just as important as working with the customer. If you don't have a salesperson, you have nothing to sell. Create a comfortable experience for your salespeople: confidence and value for their brand. Don't forget about word of mouth: one seller will appreciate your unique relationship and share with the business community that your marketplace is easy to use; this is how you build popularity and expand your pool of partners.`}

Go to the market now and use a basic version of your marketplace. Use MVPs, reduce risks and do the first product integrations that will eventually develop into a viable marketplace. Remember that Amazon started by selling books and Airbnb was just an air mattress for rent.`}
